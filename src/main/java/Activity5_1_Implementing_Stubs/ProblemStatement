Consider a scenario where you are developing a Library Management System.
In this application you have created an interface, IBookDAO, which contains
the method declaration to connect to a database, save book details, update
the details of an existing book, and delete an existing book.
Further, you have created the BookDAO class, which implements the IBookDAO
Interface.
However, this class does not implement the required logic.

To represent a book entity in the application, you have created the Book
class with various properties such as title, author, and publication.
Further, you have created the BookManager class, which can create an
instance of the Book class. The BookManager class contains the methods for
saving book details, updating the details of an existing book, and deleting
an existing book. These methods call the methods of the BookDAO class to
perform respective tasks. Now, you have to test the functionality of the
methods available in the BookManager class by creating a stub for the
BookDAO class.

How will you accomplish this task???
