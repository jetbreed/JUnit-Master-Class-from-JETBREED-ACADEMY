Ferguson has been asked to create a Password Generator
Application for a bank. The application generates a unique
password by combining the first three letters of a customer's
name with some random characters and numbers. For example,
if the name of the customer is Jame Hodge, the password can
 be Jam#$%, Jam56$, Jam#$%645, or Jam#r$5.

For this, Ferguson has developed an application that
contains a method to generate the unique password. This
method takes two strings as its parameters and concatenates
them. The first parameter accepts the first three letters of
the customer's name, and the second parameters accepts the
random characters and numbers.

Ferguson needs to test the consistency of this application
by creating a test case that accepts the following types of
values:
>>> Combination of characters and numbers.
>>> Combination of characters and special characters.
>>> Combination of characters, special characters, and numbers.

However, you have to execute a single test case for the
preceding set of values.
Help Ferguson achieve this task????
