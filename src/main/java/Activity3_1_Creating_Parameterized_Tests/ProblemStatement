Ferguson has been asked to create a Password Generator Application for
a bank. The application generates a unique password by combining the first
three letters of a customer's name with some random characters and numbers.
For example, if the name of the customer is Jame Hodge, the password can be
Jam#$%, Jam56$, Jam#$%645, or Jam#r$5.

For this, Ferguson has developed an application that contains a method to
generate the unique password. This method takes two strings as its
parameters and concatenates them. The first parameter accepts the first three
letters of the customer's name, and the second parameters accepts the
random characters and numbers.

Ferguson needs to test the consistency of this application by creating a
test case that accepts the following types of values:
>>> Combination of characters and numbers.
>>> Combination of characters and special characters.
>>> Combination of characters, special characters, and numbers.

However, you have to execute a single test case for the preceding set of
values.
Help Ferguson achieve this task????
