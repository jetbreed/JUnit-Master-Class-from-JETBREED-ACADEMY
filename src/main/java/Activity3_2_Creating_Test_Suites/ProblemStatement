             ---TEST SUITE---

Chommy, a Software Developer, has developed a Java Application to calculate
the area of a Circle, Rectangle, and Square. Each set of functionality, such
as area of rectangle, circle and square, has been implemented in separate
Java class files.
Now, she needs to test this application to verify its functionality. While
writing test cases, she needs to create a test class for each Java class.

After testing each of the classes, she needs to test the entire application
for its stability by executing all the test classes together.

Help Chommy to accomplish this task????
