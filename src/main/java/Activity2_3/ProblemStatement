Promise has been asked to modify the Area of Calculator Application by adding
an additional functionality the Area of a Parallelogram.

You have been asked to create a test case to test the functionality of this new
method. However, the coding of this new method is not yet complete, therefore,
you need to avoid the testing of the test case(s) created for this method
while running the test class.

Additionally, you have been asked to create a test case to check the exception in
case a negative value is passed as input while calculating the area of a rect-
angle.

How will you accomplish this task???
