Wendy has developed an application that calculates and displays the net
payable salary, the application calculates the HRA, the special allowance,
and the PF deduction. You have been asked to test the function that calculates
the net salary and verify whether the expected net salary matches the actual
net salary.

If a test case fails, an appropriate human-readable error message should be
displayed.

How will Wendy accomplish this task???
